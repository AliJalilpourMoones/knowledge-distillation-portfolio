# Teacher Model

This directory should contain the fine-tuned "teacher" model.

For this project, please place a fine-tuned `BART-large-CNN` model here. You can obtain this by running the `abstractive-summarization-portfolio` project and saving the final checkpoint.

The `train.py` script will expect to load the teacher model from a subdirectory named `teacher_model`.
